    <h2>About me</h2>
<p>Hi my name is Kiera. I am 21 years old and I am a student in <abbr title="Interactive Media Design">IMD</abbr>. I chose this program because I would love to work in the graphic design field but I also was interested in challenging myself and learning some more techy components as well! I definitely feel better when i am learning. I took some time off from school after the <em>horrors</em> of university level political science.</p>

<p>I'm very excited to learn a whole <b>new</b> set of skills. I spend my free time writing, doing yoga and listening to music! My favourite artist currently is Dominic Fike. In terms of favourite genres of music, i'm all over the place. I love anything that evokes feeling so i'm a true music lover in that sense. </p>
